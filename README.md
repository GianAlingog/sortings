# Sorting Shenanigans

Welcome to Sorting Shenanigans!

This project is a collection of various sorting algorithms implemented in Java. It is designed to help users understand and utilize sorting algorithms efficiently.

<sub>*This project was created for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.</sub>

## Features

- Multiple sorting algorithms including BogoSort, BubbleSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, and more.
- Easy-to-understand code with comments and documentation.
- Performance comparisons between different sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sorting Library, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GianAlingog/sortings.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd sorting-library
    ```

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own Java file. You can run the `SortingTest` class to test the different sorting algorithms. For example, to run the `SortingTest`:

```sh
javac SortingTest.java
java SortingTest
```
